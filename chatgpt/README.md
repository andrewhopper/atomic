# Atomic
**Inference-Time Fine-Tuning, Explainability, and Dynamic Model Optimization**

Atomic is an explainable, event-driven AI orchestration framework designed to optimize inference-time fine-tuning, 
real-time model selection, cost efficiency, and observability. It enables AI models to bid on microtasks dynamically, 
ensuring the best model is selected per request while maintaining structured, type-safe output.

This repository is focused on **conceptual documentation** for review by technical architects and innovators 
defining new AI orchestration standards.

## üìå Core Concepts (Goals)

1. **Explainability**  
   Traceable AI execution paths, enabling transparency for all stakeholders.

2. **Inference-Time Fine-Tuning**  
   Dynamic adaptation at runtime, eliminating heavy offline retraining workflows.

3. **Bidding on Microtasks**  
   Multiple models compete for tasks, ensuring optimal cost-performance trade-offs.

4. **Dynamic Cost & Speed Optimization**  
   Real-time decisions on which model to use, balancing latency, accuracy, and expense.

5. **Observability & Monitoring**  
   Deep debugging and structured logs for model selection, performance, and cost insights.

6. **On-Prem & Cloud Deployment**  
   Flexibility for enterprise-grade security and compliance needs.
