# Bidding System (Conceptual)

The **bidding system** is a central innovation in Atomic:

1. **Bidding Model**  
   - Each model advertises cost, latency, and domain expertise for a given microtask.
   - The orchestrator compares these bids in real time.

2. **Heuristic or RL Approach**  
   - Simple heuristics might weigh cost vs. confidence directly.
   - Advanced solutions might use reinforcement learning to continually adapt bidding strategies.

3. **Cost & Performance Balancing**  
   - Encourages cost-effective usage of heavy compute resources.
   - Less expensive or faster models may handle routine tasks; specialized models handle 
     complex or high-value tasks.

4. **Transparency**  
   - Logs show the bidding process, ensuring each microtask selection is auditable.

5. **Fairness & Future Enhancements**  
   - Mechanisms to avoid any single model dominating all tasks.
   - Potential weighting for domain-specific or lower-latency models.
