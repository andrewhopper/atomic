# Roadmap

This file details the **phased approach** for implementing Atomic. As this is a conceptual project,
timelines are estimates and may change with feedback and discovery.

---

## Phase 1: Concept & Architecture
- Document core design principles (event-driven, microtask bidding, inference-time adaptation).
- Solicit feedback from architects and innovators.

## Phase 2: Prototype & Basic Bidding
- Implement minimal proof-of-concept for microtask handling and model bidding.
- Test on sample tasks (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).

## Phase 3: Scaling & Observability
- Optimize performance for multiple concurrent tasks.
- Add structured logging, real-time dashboards, and cost-performance analytics.

## Phase 4: Production Hardening & Security
- Integrate enterprise security practices.
- Enhance reliability, governance, and compliance features.

## Phase 5: Sovereign Clean Room Execution
- Provide a specialized environment for highly regulated industries.
- Data isolation, secure enclaves, and advanced auditing for sensitive workloads.
