# Architecture Overview

Atomic’s architecture combines **event-driven orchestration**, **inference-time fine-tuning**, and 
a **bidding system** for microtasks.

## Core Components & Modules

1. **Event-Driven Orchestration**  
   - Each incoming request triggers a workflow (e.g., email arrival).
   - Orchestration can be handled by platforms like Temporal or AWS Step Functions.

2. **Inference-Time Fine-Tuning**  
   - Instead of statically picking a single pre-trained model, the system tailors the model 
     at runtime using minimal incremental updates or context-specific parameters.

3. **Marketplace Bidding**  
   - Models “bid” on microtasks by indicating confidence, cost, latency, etc.
   - The orchestrator picks the optimal combination (lowest cost for acceptable confidence, or 
     highest accuracy for time-sensitive tasks, etc.).

4. **Observability & Logging**  
   - Provides robust logging for each decision: which model was selected, why, and how long it took.
   - Ensures developers and stakeholders can trace the AI pipeline.

5. **Sovereign Clean Room Execution**  
   - Future concept for isolating sensitive data in highly regulated or privacy-centric environments.
   - Could leverage secure enclaves or specialized compliance frameworks.
