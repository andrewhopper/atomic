# Atomic Architecture

## System Overview

Atomic is an event-driven AI orchestration framework built on a model bidding system and inference-time fine-tuning. The architecture enables dynamic model selection for optimal performance, cost efficiency, and comprehensive observability.

## Core Components

### 1. Orchestration Layer

The orchestration layer uses either Temporal or AWS Step Functions (not both) to coordinate the workflow:

- **Event Processing**: Manages the flow of events through the system
- **State Management**: Maintains execution state across distributed components
- **Error Handling**: Provides fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms
- **Task Scheduling**: Coordinates execution timing across components

### 2. Model Bidding System

The bidding system is the central innovation of Atomic:

- **Task Decomposer**: Breaks complex requests into microtasks
- **Bid Manager**: Collects and evaluates bids from candidate models
- **Selection Engine**: Uses RL-based algorithms to select optimal models
- **Performance Tracker**: Records execution metrics to inform future bids

The bidding process works like an auction marketplace:
1. Models submit bids based on their confidence, cost, and expected latency
2. The bid manager evaluates bids using configurable criteria
3. The most efficient model is selected for each microtask
4. Results are recorded to improve future selection decisions

### 3. Inference-Time Fine-Tuning Engine

This component enables models to adapt at runtime without full retraining:

- **Context Analyzer**: Determines appropriate adaptation strategy
- **Parameter Adjuster**: Modifies model parameters based on task requirements
- **Prompt Engineer**: Dynamically constructs optimal prompts for each task
- **Feedback Integrator**: Applies execution results to improve future runs

### 4. Structured Output Manager

Ensures type safety and schema compliance:

- **Schema Registry**: Maintains output schemas for different task types
- **Validation Engine**: Validates outputs against defined schemas
- **Type Enforcer**: Ensures type consistency across the system
- **Error Handler**: Manages schema violations gracefully

### 5. Observability System

Provides comprehensive visibility into system operation:

- **Execution Logger**: Records detailed information about each execution
- **Decision Tracker**: Captures model selection rationale
- **Metrics Collector**: Gathers performance and operational metrics
- **Visualization Engine**: Creates dashboards for monitoring and analysis

## Data Flow

1. **Request Ingestion**: Client submits a request through the API
2. **Task Decomposition**: Request is broken down into microtasks
3. **Bid Collection**: Available models submit bids for each microtask
4. **Model Selection**: Optimal models are selected based on bids
5. **Inference Execution**: Selected models perform their assigned tasks
6. **Result Validation**: Outputs are validated against schemas
7. **Response Assembly**: Results are combined into a final response
8. **Feedback Loop**: Execution metrics update model profiles

## Security Architecture

### Sovereign Clean Room

For regulated industries and sensitive workloads:

- **Data Isolation**: Ensures data remains within secure boundaries
- **Execution Verification**: Validates model behavior integrity
- **Audit Trail**: Provides comprehensive execution audit logs
- **Compliance Framework**: Supports regulatory requirements

## Deployment Models

Atomic supports flexible deployment options:

### On-Premise Deployment
- Full support for air-gapped environments
- Enterprise security integration
- Hardware optimization capabilities

### Cloud Deployment
- Managed service with auto-scaling
- Multi-region availability
- Integration with cloud observability tools

## Integration Points

Atomic provides multiple integration methods:

- **REST API**: Standard HTTP interface for synchronous requests
- **Event Streams**: For asynchronous, event-driven integration
- **SDK Libraries**: For programmatic integration in Python, Go, and JavaScript
- **Webhook Callbacks**: For notification of execution results

## Technology Selection Rationale

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Orchestration | Temporal OR AWS Step Functions | Reliable workflow management with strong consistency |
| Execution | DSPy, Texts, BAML | Modern frameworks designed for AI workflow execution |
| Structured Output | Outlines, BAML | Strong type safety and schema validation |
| Model Selection | RL-Based Bidding | Optimal cost-performance trade-offs through competition |
| Storage | PostgreSQL, Knowledge Graphs | Relational efficiency with semantic capabilities |
| API & Backend | Python, Rust, Go | Ecosystem compatibility (Python) with high performance (Rust/Go) |
| Observability | Structured Logging | Complete visibility into system behavior |

## Performance Considerations

The architecture addresses key performance concerns:

- **Latency Management**: Minimizes bidding overhead through parallel processing
- **Execution Optimization**: Selects models based on efficiency metrics
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimizes resource utilization across components
- **Scalability**: Supports horizontal scaling for high-volume workloads

## Future Evolution

The architecture is designed to evolve in the following directions:

1. **Federated Execution**: Support for distributed model execution across environments
2. **Multi-Modal Processing**: Extending the framework to handle diverse data types
3. **Edge Integration**: Support for edge computing scenarios
4. **Custom Model Integration**: Framework for adding proprietary models
5. **Hybrid Intelligence**: Seamless combining of human and AI decisions
