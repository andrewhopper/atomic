# Atomic
**Inference-Time Fine-Tuning, Explainability, and Dynamic Model Optimization**

Atomic is an explainable, event-driven AI orchestration framework designed to optimize inference-time fine-tuning, real-time model selection, cost efficiency, and observability. It enables AI models to bid on microtasks dynamically, ensuring the best model is selected per request while maintaining structured, type-safe output using Outlines and BoundaryML’s BAML.

## 📌 Core Goals

1. **Explainability** → AI execution paths must be transparent & traceable.  
2. **Inference-Time Fine-Tuning** → Models must dynamically adapt at runtime, without retraining.  
3. **Dynamic Cost Optimization** → Minimize cost by choosing the best-performing model for each task.  
4. **Bidding on Microtasks** → AI models compete for execution, ensuring optimal performance/cost trade-offs.  
5. **Speed Optimization** → Minimize latency while maintaining accuracy.  
6. **Observability & Monitoring** → Enable deep debugging, structured logging, and real-time insights.  
7. **Type-Safe Structured Output** → Ensure reliable, structured responses via Outlines and BAML.  
8. **On-Premise & Cloud Deployment** → Enterprise-ready with strict data governance & security compliance.
