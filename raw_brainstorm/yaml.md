## 🔬 How It Works

1. **Model Bidding System**  
   - Task-based competition: Models bid for microtasks, optimizing cost-performance trade-offs.  
   - Ad Exchange-like Strategy: Models submit bids based on execution efficiency.

2. **Inference-Time Fine-Tuning**  
   - Dynamic Execution: Models adjust at runtime without retraining.  
   - Adaptive Learning: Leverages real-time feedback to optimize future inferences.

3. **Structured AI Output with Type Safety**  
   - **Outlines** → Ensures type safety in AI calls.  
   - **BAML (BoundaryML)** → Enables structured, schema-based outputs.

4. **Observability & Debugging**  
   - Structured Execution Logs → Track why a model was selected.  
   - Real-Time Dashboards → Monitor performance, cost, and accuracy.
